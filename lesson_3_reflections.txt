When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    -When we need to collaborate.
    -When we need to make the work available for others either privately or publicly.
    -When we need to be mobile and use multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    -When my experiments need not be made public I will be able to create branches only in the local repository and keep them private.
    -Gives me control over when something can be made available for other contributors.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    -Forks: Use when you want to work on an already created project.  You can leave the orginal as is and work on your copy or fork.
        This method protects the original repository as changes made in forks do not automatically update original.
        Forking is available only in remote github.
    -Clones: Use when creating a local copy in your computer from the remote.  Both clone and source are kept synced by using push and pull commands.
    -Branch: Use when deviating from an existing git.  Branch helps us experiment without affecting other branches.
        We can also use it to create versions with variations.
        Branches can be merged whenever necessary and thus this method is very useful for development.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    -Git status will provide information regarding current state of remote even if we are offline.
