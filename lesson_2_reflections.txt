What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    The folder in which I run the git init command becomes a git repsoitory.
    A hidden folder ".git" is created for keeping track of changes.
    Files are not tracked yet as no staging has been done.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    Staging area provides the benefit of combining multiple files into a single commit.
